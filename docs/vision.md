# Vision

We are the proud owners of a small, ten-room hotel.

We need a system for managing reservations and guests, including check-in/check-out functionality.

Guests should be able to book rooms online, and housekeeping should be able to update room status.

Key actors:

- Guest (Online Booking)
- Receptionist (On-site Management)
- Manager (Reporting and Administration)
- Housekeeping (Room Service)
